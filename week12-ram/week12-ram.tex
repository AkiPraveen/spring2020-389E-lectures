                    \item Projects 5, 6, and 7 are now released on Piazza
                    \item Relevant instructional material is/will be linked
                    \item They can be done in \textbf{any order}, but I would suggest doing them in order (5, then 6, then 7)
                    \item We already did a lecture on Project 5 and 6, today we'll be talking about \textbf{Project 7}

    			\begin{itemize}
    				\item We've built the ALU; the brains of the operation
    				\item Now we need a few more things to take this from just a calculator circuit to an actual computer
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item Ways to \textbf{store} programs
    					\item Ways to \textbf{interpret} those programs
    					\item Ways to \textbf{execute} those programs
    					\item Ways to \textbf{store data} for those programs while they're executing
    				\end{itemize}
    				\item We're going to use the digital logic circuit theory to build circuits to address all of these! (Projects 5, 6, and 7)

    					\item Ways to \textbf{execute} those programs - \textbf{Program Counter} \textit{(Project 6)}
    					\item Ways to \textbf{store data} for those programs while they're executing - \textbf{RAM} \textit{(Project 7)}

    			\frametitle{Approach}
    			\begin{itemize}
    				\item Let's figure out our approach to this.
    				\item Right now, we have circuits in place to iterate through the lines of code we're written and provide us with the exact instruction for every line
    				\item Now, while our interpreter circuit (which we have not yet created) is actually executing that code, where will it store the values it calculates?
    				\item We need \textbf{fast-access}, \textbf{modifiable} memory that we can use to store the values that we calculate.
    			\end{itemize}
    		\end{frame}
    		
    		\begin{frame}
    			\frametitle{Approach}
    			\begin{itemize}
    				\item In other words, we need \textbf{registers} for our computer.
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item Aside: What are registers exactly? Think back to 216 and Assembly
    				\end{itemize}
    				\item At the end of the day, these requirements are pretty much filled out by RAM
    				\item First, we're going to look at the concept of RAM as a whole, and figure out why it's the perfect choice for us here
    				\item Then, we'll talk about implementation in Minecraft

             			\item Static RAM and Dynamic RAM

             		\item DRAM takes up less space, though, (seems counterintuitive, but it's true)
             		\item As such, we use DRAM in the actual RAM chips on our computers (DDR4, DDR5, etc)

             		\item As such, we don't need to worry about differentiating between RAM architectures or even building a cache

             		\item Previously on CMSC389E, you worked with ROM, which was \textit{read-only}
             		\item You've also seen the background for basic latches
             		\begin{itemize}
             			\item Remember, latches are just augmented flip-flops. Look back to the 'memory' lecture if you need a refresher.
             		\end{itemize}
             		\item We also talked about using a form of latch-based storage to keep track of the numbers we were counting for our program counter

             		\item Think of this next problem we're tackling as a further exploration of consistent value storage, as a beautiful combination of the last two projects you worked on
             		\item We're going to store data in a similar way to what you've seen in the ROM (using a neat decoder-based technique to \textbf{read} from it)
             		\item We're going to use latches in an intelligent way (similar to what you saw in the program counter project) in order to \textbf{write} data

             		\item Remove any extraneous bits from that logical circuit
             		\item Cut that down to a more compact, modular form (we want to put a bunch of RAM together!)

        			\item We don't have to concern ourselves with the nuances of electronics, nor do we have the same spatial limitations of the real world
        			\item What we do have is limited time and workload expectation, so that's what we're forced to work with
        			\item \textbf{TL;DR} we made things easier when making certain architectural choices. You are still building a functional computer, albeit a \textit{very} simple one.
